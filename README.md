# Five Card Stud Poker
This project is a game of Five Card Stud Poker written in Java with a fully functioning GUI. 

## Summary
The program is made up of interfaces and classes to represent a card, a deck of cards, a poker hand, a poker game, and a main class to run the game. Running the main class will initiate a graphical game of Five Card Stud Poker. The player can set the ante and click bet then click deal to initiate the game. Upon clicking deal the player's hand will become visible and one card of the dealer's hand will also become visible. At this point the player has the option to fold or double down. If the player folds, the dealer wins the hand, and the player loses the ante. If the player doubles down, the dealer's hand will be revealed, and the better hand will win the entire pot. The game continues until the player runs out of chips or decides to "cash out" by exiting the game.
